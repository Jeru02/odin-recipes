    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A chocolate brownie is a rich, dense, and fudgy baked dessert made from a combination of melted chocolate, butter, sugar, eggs, and flour. Its texture is typically soft and chewy, with a slightly crispy top that gives way to a moist, gooey interior. Brownies have an intense chocolate flavor, often enhanced with a touch of vanilla extract or a sprinkle of salt. They can be enjoyed plain or with added ingredients like walnuts, pecans, or chocolate chips for extra texture and taste. Served warm or at room temperature, brownies are often paired with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, a drizzle of chocolate sauce, or a dusting of powdered sugar, making them a favorite indulgence for chocolate lovers.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>1 Â½ cups all-purpose flour</li>  
        <li>1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li> 
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>

        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
