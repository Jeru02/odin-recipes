    <h1>Lasagna</h1>
    <img src="../img/lasagna.jpeg" alt="A creamy Lasgana">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a hearty Italian dish made of layers of wide, flat pasta sheets, rich tomato-based meat sauce, creamy béchamel or ricotta cheese, and a blend of cheeses, usually mozzarella and Parmesan. The pasta sheets are layered with the sauce and cheese, then baked in the oven until bubbly and golden brown on top. The meat sauce often includes ground beef or sausage, simmered with garlic, onions, and tomatoes, sometimes enriched with red wine and herbs like oregano and basil. The result is a comforting, multi-layered casserole with a delicious combination of textures and flavors—soft pasta, savory meat, creamy cheese, and a crispy, cheesy top. Lasagna is often enjoyed as a satisfying main course and is a staple in both casual family dinners and special occasions. - ChatGPT</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Meat: This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</li>
        <li>Onion and garlic: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</li>
        <li>Tomato products: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>
        <li>Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
        <li>Spices and seasonings: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>  
        <li>Lasagna noodles: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li> 
        <li>Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>  
        <li>Egg: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Noodles:

            Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
            Add the lasagna noodles and cook according to the package instructions until al dente.
            Drain the noodles and lay them flat on a baking sheet to prevent sticking.</li>

        <li>Cook the Meat Sauce:

            In a large skillet, cook the ground beef or Italian sausage over medium heat until browned.
            Add the chopped onion and garlic, and sauté until the onion is soft and translucent.
            Stir in the marinara sauce, season with salt, pepper, and dried basil or Italian seasoning.
            Simmer the sauce for about 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.</li>
        
        <li>Prepare the Cheese Mixture:

            In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, and half of the grated Parmesan cheese.
            Mix until smooth, and season with a little salt and pepper.</li>

        <li>Assemble the Lasagna:

            Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
            Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce at the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.
            Place a layer of cooked lasagna noodles over the sauce (usually 3 noodles).
            Spread a portion of the ricotta mixture evenly over the noodles.
            Sprinkle a layer of shredded mozzarella cheese over the ricotta.
            Add another layer of meat sauce on top of the cheese.
            Repeat the layers (noodles, ricotta, mozzarella, sauce) until you've used all the ingredients, finishing with a layer of meat sauce and topping it with the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.</li>

        
        <li>Bake the Lasagna:

            Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil, tenting it slightly to prevent the cheese from sticking.
            Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes.
            Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the cheese is melted, bubbly, and slightly golden on top.</li>

        <li>Let it Rest:

            Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it rest for about 10-15 minutes before slicing. This allows the layers to set and makes it easier to cut.</li> 
            
        <li>Serve:

            Garnish with fresh basil or parsley, if desired.
            Slice and serve hot, paired with a side salad or garlic bread. Enjoy your homemade lasagna!</li>
